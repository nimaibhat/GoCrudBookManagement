<h1 align="center"> Go Crud Book Management </h1>

This repository contains a lightweight, but highly scalable CRUD API project built using GoLang and mongoDB as the backend database. The project is built specifically for books, but this is just an example as it can be generalized to any sort of data. GoLang is chosen for it's extremely fast performance, as well as it's versatility. mongoDB is also used for it's speed, but also scalability to even the largest applications. gin is used as the HTTP framework, which is another lightweight, efficient program. Also, security measures such as custom middleware (not adjusted for every status code yet) as well as CORS are enabled with the program, ensuring that even if errors & panic occur, data will be secure.
